# kubecon-talk
## Intro
Hey. I'm Eirik aka clux on github and am one of the main maintainers on kube-rs.

Today, talking about the kubernetes api, generic assumptions and invariants that kubernetes wants to maintain, but is for the lack of actual generics in the language, is in many cases a best-effort ordeal, and in other cases completely broken.


## client go
note all the duplicate implemetations

## types
trying to catch errors with type safety rather than --pattern and passive code generation (like kubebuilder)
